Problem 7.9 - Chapter 7, Project A
---------------------------------------------
Enhance the program in Programming Project 7.20.8 so that each student has ten quiz scores.
The input contains the student names and quiz scores but no course grades.
The program should compute the course grade.
If the sum of the quiz scores is at least 90, the grade is an A.
If the sum is at least 80, the grade is a B, and so on.
Then print all students with grade A together with their individual quiz scores,
followed by all students with grade B, and so on.
